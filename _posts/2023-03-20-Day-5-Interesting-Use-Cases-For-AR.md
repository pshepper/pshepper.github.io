## Day 5 - Interesting Use Cases for AR

With the seemingly imminent release of an Apple headset I've been thinking about ways to use such a device. There are conflicting reports about whether this product is going to be a virtual reality headset, where you see none of the real word, or and augmented reality headset, where you can see the real world and program gets shown on top of it. An AR device is much more likely to make an impact on the world and see mass adoption. The clear end goal for these products is to get an eye contact that can overlay programs onto your vision. Here is a simple list of use cases that I can think of for such a dream device in no particular order.

1. Virtual monitors
2. Real world puzzles to solve
3. Virtual dice throws
4. Something that recognizes faces and gives relevant information[^1]
5. Turn by turn directions overlayed on top your vision (also good for trails)
6. Star guide
7. Way to lower the brightness of light entering your vision
8. Concert visuals
9. Automatic translation of writings

Much of what I have listed already exist but inside apps on your phones. There are two key parts to make the technology game changing. One is having devices able to show the same object to multiple people as if the object is physically there. The second is running some computation on everything you see at all times. A device can look up information relevant to what you're looking at and show it to you before you even realize what entered your gaze. It is both scary and fascinating.
