## Day 2 Color

A few weeks ago Apple released a [yellow iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/iphone-14-yellow-apple-store-pickup-available/) as part of a mid-cycle update.[^1] Normally, I pick the *boring* color for technology devices. While color preference is subjective anyone can tell you the boring colors to pick. Those are usually a darkish grey and a light silver color. Almost every product offers some variety of those colors and they usually sell pretty well. For good reason too. They look good in almost any setting and hold up well to expected damage during use.

I've been trying to pick more exciting colors lately. These products are supposed to be fun and by choosing standard colors I wonder if I'm making them less enticing to use. I have started to enjoy objects that make bold color choices and wear them proudly. A bold color stands out on my desk or elsewhere making it easier to spot. This can of course go too far and lead to some non-sensible color choices. Like all things, there's a balance to be had. However many products never even search for this balance and simply don't offers colors outside of grey and silver.  I want a bit more color in my life.
