## Goals of writing on here

People often describe the times between graduating and starting their jobs as bliss because there is seemingly a lack of responsibility and expectations.
My current experience is the opposite. I find not having a daily schedule to follow personally anxiety enducing. When presented with no real reason to get up and take on the day I will passively let the days pass me by. I recognzie this is my personal doing as the limits of the internet and software developing are limitless.
So in order to tackle my current situation I plan on giving myself a job. I have never been the best writer but cliches are often correct so there's no better way to get better than actually writing.
I currently plan on trying to write something interesting once every 2 weeks. There are no set topics and ideas come from all around but I will try and discover about technologies and ideas that I don't already know much about.
