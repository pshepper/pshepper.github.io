## Day 11 - Mornings

I'm aware in the irony in my last post being about weekends and this one being about mornings. Apparently all I think about now is time of the days and weeks. Promise this one will be short though.

At some point in in university I realized I was a morning person. I almost don't understand my friends who say they're *night owls* because how can you not enjoy the mornings. The quiet still air hitting your newly fresh face. The time to reflect on the day you want. Mornings are not time to reflect on the past but to plan for the future. It's selfish to say that if everyone was a morning person it wouldn't be the same but it's true. Part of the morning satisfaction is being up before everyone else. Being up and about while things are opening. Before the hustle of the day begins. Where only the animals are usually and about. However there is something naturally beautiful about a rising sun and how mornings first light reflects off everything. Mornings are a bliss time that everyone should experience at least once.

That's the closest I'll get to writing a poem but I have come to appreciate the mornings.
