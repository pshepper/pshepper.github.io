# Day 15 - Secret weird things people do

## Sorry for missing days

I've missed a few days. It started with one and piled after that. I'm going to stop forcing myself to do daily. Two weeks is enough of a sample size to tell me that I don't enjoy it and don't believe I'm improving at it. Having one a week that I take time to plan and edit is better. They still may be shorter but at least I won't be dreading it.

## Secret Weird things people do

One of my favorite podcast [Reconcilable Differences](https://www.relay.fm/rd) has a reoccurring segment where the host discuss what they call "secret weird things people do". The general idea is that everyone has weird parts of their daily routine that doesn't come up in conversation and therefore it's hard to judge whether it's something that the majority of people do or not. Usually these involve more person topics like personal hygiene and room organization. The newest secret weird thing is having a cup in the bathroom that you use to rinse your mouth. [John Siracusa](https://mastodon.social/@siracusa) was amazed to learn that not everyone keeps a cup in their bathroom.

I love thinking about these secret weird things because it shows how everyone develops different habits often with no logical reasoning. At the end of the day people just do what feels best for them. Whether that's putting on your shirt before our pants or keeping a cup by your sink.
