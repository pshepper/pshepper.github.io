## Day 13 - The joy of a seasons change

As we March towards the end of the month it's clear that there is a changing in the seasons. Gone are the desolate winter nights and icy mornings. While in the moment everyone despises the sub-freezing temperatures I think it adds to the enjoyment of spring. In the northeast US you can't take any nice day for granted and everyone knows this. On the first nice day of the year crowds of people flock out to any public place they can. There is this understanding among people that we we have a limited number of nice days and we're all trying to enjoy it in out own way.

It's always free to enjoy a nice day.
