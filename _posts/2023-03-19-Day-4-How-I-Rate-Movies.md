## Day 4 -How I rate movies

The first item many people learn about me is how I'm a *movie person*. This brings the conversation in many different directions but on more than one occasion someone has said "I think most movies I see are good. How do you make know if a movie is good or bad". I often don't know how to respond because it's not something easy to put into words. Sometimes it's just a feeling a movie gives me. A fair few movies cause me to experience some emotion after seeing them and some don't. This isn't entirely fair because every person is different and a movie may be hitting someone at just the right time and place of their life. This is just part of it and trying to separate the subconscious emotional part of a film away from its technical aspects is almost impossible. That's not the say the technical aspects can't be looked at and some movies are *technically* better made than others. A badly edited movie can still strike a cord with someone and their opinion of the movie is just as valid as someone who is taken out of the movie by bad editing. The great thing about opinions is that there aren't any wrong ones. Everyones experience of a film is their own and only they should determine it's worth.

We are reaching some bigger topics that are too important for my silly short form writings so I will end by leaving of list of questions I consider when looking at a movie[^1]. The order is loosely related to importance.
1. What emotion was the creators trying to evoke out of me? Was it effective? How did they attempt to achieve this?
2. Was the story compelling? Did I care about the characters and did their motives make sense? Did the film have well thought out progression through its story?
3. Are the visuals interesting? Does it shoot the characters or setting in an interesting way that helps tells the story? I personally love when movies play with colors.
4. If there's music, is it compelling and add to the emotional experience? (see 1)
5. Does the production set and costume fit the setting being told?
