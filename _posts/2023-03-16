## Day 1 - Walking

I enjoy walking. If I'm struggling with something I often go for a walk to find the answer. Surprisingly I do find that answer somewhere along that walk. As if it was a berry on a leaf in my sight. A walk is also good for when you aren't looking for anything. Occasionally the answer to a question you weren't even looking for will come to you on a walk. 

I go on walks on my own volition but there was a time where I aimed to get 10,000 steps a day. This was during university so it wasn't difficult. I was already walking to class and some days it only required taking a longer way to my dorm. Which I pleasantly enjoyed. There were however days where I would check my steps at 10pm and find that I was 1,000 or so off. For whatever reason I was compelled to get up and pace back and forth until I hit the 10,000 milestone. These *fake walks* didn't lead to any answers like my other walks. I simply did them for the sake of hitting a number[^1]. I have since stopped intentionally aiming for this 10,000 number but still get enjoyment every time I see that I hit it.

It is frustratingly affective how simply moving your body can mentally make you feel better. I am never in a bad mood after I go for a walk. Save the times in heavy wind or rain. It's also a great excuse for me to catch up on listening to new music or podcast. A list that somehow only gets bigger and never smaller. I hope to approach everything in my life in the same way I go on my walk. One step at a time.
