## Day 8 - Simple Rules

There are a few sayings that stick in my head. Sayings that are usually in the form of rules that my head digs up when I'm not in the *mood* to do something or need that internal motivation. Some rules are also how I govern my interaction with people. Everything has different philosophies but these are mine.

1. If it takes less than 5 minutes, do it now.
2. Take 2 or something if you see yourself replacing it within 6 months.
3. Sometimes help isn't needed. Not being in the way is more important.
4. Everything should have a place.
5. If you're not doing it now. Set a reminder.
6. You always have time to warmup, whether it's a physical or mental task.
7. Fix or note a mistake the moment you see it.
8. If while driving you have the thought of needing to stop by somewhere. Do it then.

That first rule covers almost anything I do on a day to day basis. Not many things take actions take over 5 minutes and this forces me to do all the little things around the house like putting shoes in the right place or cleaning dishes right after eating.
